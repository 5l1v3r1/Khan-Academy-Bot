# Khan-Academy-Bot
##### Automates Khan Academy quizzes by brute forcing questions (30<sec per quiz). Can be used for farming energy points or in my case automate boring school requirements...

- **Usage**
   - Of course with any python project you'll need to install the necessary packages etc
   - Replace direcotry path to chromedriver (I put the chrome one in the git repo but if you dont use chrome replace it https://selenium.dev/downloads/#client-drivers)
   - Change username and password credentials
   - Change link to the quiz you want to automate
   
- **To-Do**
  - Fix bot crapping out when trying to finish a previous half finished question (a quiz a human took)
  - Fix some of the static delays to dynamiclly change to when the element if present (I already wrote the function in the code just implement it)
  - Create a while loop to re-do same quiz infinitely (for farming energy points)
